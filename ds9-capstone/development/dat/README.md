This folder is uploaded to GitHub with this README file only.

It is filled up with four files, as follows, after running the following codes:
* ./Rscript 1-create-edx-validation-sets.R
* ./Rscript 2-create-trainset-testset.R

After running the above scripts, the following files are created:
* edx.csv, validation.csv, as created by the original problem statement (script 1 above);
* train.csv, test.csv, which are the split of edx.csv used to modelling and tuning the ML algorythms.
